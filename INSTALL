UDP Network Communications Library (UNCL) Installation

To install type 'make install' as the root user.
By default, this will install the library libuncl in /usr/lib and the header
file uncl.h in /usr/include. If you wish to override the default install
location type 'make install PREFIX=mydir' where "mydir" is substituted for /usr.
